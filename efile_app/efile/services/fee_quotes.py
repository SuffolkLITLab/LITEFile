"""Whether the fee quote on a draft still describes the filing it would price.

A quote is asked of the EFSP on Payment and shown again on Review. Anything
the filer changes afterwards -- the court, the case type, a document's filing
type, an optional service -- can change what the court charges, and it can be
changed from any of half a dozen screens. Rather than have each of them
remember to clear the quote, the quote carries a fingerprint of everything it
was priced on, and is only ever treated as current while the draft still
matches it.
