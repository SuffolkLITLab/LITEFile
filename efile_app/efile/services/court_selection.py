"""Ask a filer the questions their own state's court structure actually needs.

Every e-filing service hands us one flat list of "courts": 207 of them in
Illinois, 170 in Massachusetts, 24 in Vermont. Dropping that list into a single
dropdown asks the filer to recognize their court among the ones that come
alphabetically near it, which is why a Peoria filer used to open the list on a
Cook County division.

The way out is not one better dropdown. It is asking the questions each state's
hierarchy is actually made of -- Illinois routes by county, Massachusetts by
court department plus a place the filer knows, Vermont by Superior Court unit --
and letting the answers narrow the same live list. So the questions live in each
jurisdiction's YAML (``court_selector:``) rather than in this module, and this
module is the small engine that runs them:

* a **step** is one question. It is shown when its ``when:`` conditions hold and
  it has something to ask; ``choice`` renders as radio cards, ``select`` as a
  dropdown, and ``location`` as a place lookup handed to a matcher.
* an **option** may carry a **court query** -- a few declarative rules matched
  against the live list. Answering a step narrows the pool to that query.
* the deepest answered step wins, so a broad answer ("Cook County") is replaced
  by the narrower one under it ("Cook County - Chancery - District 1").
* when the pool is down to a single court, that is the selection. When it is
  down to a handful, the filer picks from those instead of from 207.

Nothing here hardcodes a state. A jurisdiction with no ``court_selector:`` block
keeps the flat list it has today.

Court **names**, not codes, are what partner configuration matches on wherever
there is a choice: Tyler's codes differ per court and change without notice.
Codes still do the filing.
