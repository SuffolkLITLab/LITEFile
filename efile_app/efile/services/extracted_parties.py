"""Turn the names printed on a document into the parties a filing needs.

Extraction reads a lead document for who is on it: plaintiffs or petitioners,
defendants or respondents, and anyone else the caption names alongside their
stated role. Those answers are *sides* (see ``efile.party_sides``), which is
exactly what makes them usable straight away -- the filer can see and correct
every name on the same screen the document was read on, long before the court
and case type that decide the real party-type codes have been confirmed.

Nothing here guesses a court party type. Mapping a side onto one court's code
is ``efile.services.people.apply_party_sides``, and it runs later, once there
is a case type to fetch the list for.
