"""The filer's name and address, as their e-filing account already knows them.

This used to be reachable only through ``/api/auth/profile/``, which the "Your
information" page called from JavaScript after the page had rendered. The filer
therefore watched an empty form appear, waited, and then saw their own name drop
into it -- long enough to wonder why a system they had just signed in to did not
know who they were.

Pulling the fetch into a service lets the view ask for the profile *before* it
renders, so the fields are filled on first paint, while the API endpoint keeps
working unchanged for the pages that still call it.

Two calls are needed because Tyler splits the answer: the firm record carries
the address and phone, and the user record carries the name.
