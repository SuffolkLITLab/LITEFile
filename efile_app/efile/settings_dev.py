# stand-in PDFs against a real court. Every other guard on that setting keys off
# DEBUG, so none of them would fire in exactly this case.

# turns a silent misconfiguration into a boot failure. Deliberately no override

# Static files: serve dev assets through WhiteNoise, as staging and production do.

# Cache-Control, which leaves the browser free to guess a freshness lifetime
# (Chrome: a fraction of the file's age) and reuse a script for hours without
# revalidating. A JS change then reaches the tests and never reaches the browser
# -- which is how an upload page shipped a validation check that the running app
# did not have, and let a filing go out with no filing type selected.
